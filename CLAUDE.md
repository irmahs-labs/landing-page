# CLAUDE.md

## Git branches

Always pull before making changes: run `git fetch origin` and start from the latest `origin/main` before the first edit.

- On a branch whose PR is open, bring it up to date with `origin/main` first
- On `main`, or on a branch whose PR is already merged, create a new branch from `origin/main` instead

Always name the branch after the feature or fix it contains, never a random or generated name.

- Format: `<type>/<feature-name>` in lowercase kebab-case
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`
- Examples: `feat/contact-form`, `fix/dark-mode-contrast`, `chore/ultracite-hook`
- If the session assigns a generic branch (for example `claude/<random-words>`), create a feature-named branch instead and push there

## Pull requests

- Never push to `main`. Every change goes in through a pull request.
- Open the PR and stop there: never merge it, not even when CI is green. Irma reviews and clicks merge.
- Deploys run on merge to `main`. Re-run a deploy only when Irma asks.

## Checks before pushing

```sh
npm run check      # Ultracite (oxlint + oxfmt); CI fails on it
npm run typecheck
npm test           # vitest
npm run build
```

The PostToolUse hook in `.claude/hooks/ultracite.sh` runs Ultracite and the typecheck on every file you edit.

## Languages

The site reads in English or French. The choice is `src/lib/language.ts`: kept in localStorage and in a `lang` cookie on `irmahs.dev` that every irmahs.dev app reads and writes, so one pick carries across the apps. The header's EN/FR pill (`src/components/language-toggle.tsx`) and the EN and FR pills in `profile.exe` both switch it. Every string a visitor sees has both versions, in a `COPY = { en, fr }` object beside the component that shows it (`useCopy(COPY)`), and dates go through `LOCALES`. Tokkae's newest changelog entry carries its French in `fr`.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
