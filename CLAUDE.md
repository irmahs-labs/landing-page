# CLAUDE.md

## Git branches

Always pull before making changes: run `git fetch origin` and start from the latest `origin/main` before the first edit.

- On a branch whose PR is open, bring it up to date with `origin/main` first
- On `main`, or on a branch whose PR is already merged, create a new branch from `origin/main` instead

Always name the branch after the feature or fix it contains, never a random or generated name.

- Format: `<type>/<feature-name>` in lowercase kebab-case
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`
- Examples: `feat/contact-form`, `fix/dark-mode-contrast`, `chore/ultracite-hook`
- If the session assigns a generic branch (for example `claude/<random-words>`), create a feature-named branch instead and push there

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
